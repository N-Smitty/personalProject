            <p>
              There are many breeds of dogs. Each breed varies in size and
              temperament. Owners often select a breed of dog that they find to
              be compatible with their own lifestyle and desires from a
              companion.

            How do you acquire a dog?
          </Accordion.Title>
          <Accordion.Content active={activeIndex === 2}>
            <p>
              Three common ways for a prospective owner to acquire a dog is from
              pet shops, private owners, or shelters.
            </p>
            <p>
              A pet shop may be the most convenient way to buy a dog. Buying a
              dog from a private owner allows you to assess the pedigree and
              upbringing of your dog before choosing to take it home. Lastly,
              finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good home to a dog
              who may not find one so readily.
